                <p>
                    With a Canon 5D Mark IV, &nbsp;I take and edit photos of mainly my pets. 
                    <br> Occassionally, I will take pictures at some VSA events on campus to sharpen
                    <br> my skills.

                <p>
                    I enjoy playing games with friends and family! Some games I play often include 
                    <br> Minecraft, Valorant, Mobile Legends, and Roblox's Bee Swarm Simulator. 
                    <br> I highly recommend people try out these games.

                <h3>Walking</h3>
                <p>
                    One day, I randomly decided to challenge myself by walking 10,000 steps before
                    <br> 1 pm hit. Ever since, I found a passion to walk anywhere that is safe like 
                    <br> walking to the nearest boba store. I am apart of a walking class (KNES120) at 
                    <br> UMD too.

            <h3>After-School Instructor @ Olive Consulting</h3>
            I led a class of 10 to 20 middle school students through class material and activities at 
            Montgomery County Public Schools Excel Beyond the Bell program. I taught both graphic design and 
            cartoon animation. To aide class content, I planned class worksheets and developed connections
            with students to spark motivation in completing classwork.

            <h3>Test Result Checker (Project)</h3>
            I implemented a C program that ran tests and created a file of the test outputs. For each test, I
            built a folder of text files to display discrepancies between expected and actual results. To accomplish
            this, I processed results with child processes to run multiple tests simultaneously. Then, I organized 
            the files into a directory with specified read, write, and execute user permissions.

            <h3>Student Government Association @ Montgomery College</h3>
            As a Student Senator, I collaborated with faculty and other student senators to advocate for 
            students on campus. More specifically, I helped organize events that promoted community, allocated
            funds to club events using budgeting techniques. Then, I interviewed and evaluated applications
            for other student senator positions.
